# ✅ BEFORE PUBLISHING TO GITHUB

## Required Action: Create the Anki Template File

### Why is this needed?

Your documentation references `Anki Arabic Template/Arabic Template.apkg` as a pre-made template file that users can import. **This file doesn't exist yet!** You need to create it once so users can skip manual Anki setup.

### How to create it (10 minutes)

Follow the detailed guide: **`Anki Arabic Template/CREATE_TEMPLATE.md`**

Quick summary:
1. Open Anki
2. Create "Arabic" deck
3. Create "Arabic Card" note type with 8 fields
4. Customize card templates (front/back)
5. Export as `.apkg` file
6. Save to `Anki Arabic Template/Arabic Template.apkg`
7. Commit to repository

### Why include this file?

**Without the .apkg file:**
- Users must manually create note type (10-15 minutes)
- Users must configure 8 fields correctly
- Users must write HTML/CSS for card templates
- High risk of setup errors
- Beginners may give up

**With the .apkg file:**
- Users import in **30 seconds** ⚡
- Zero configuration required
- Works immediately
- Perfect for beginners ✅

### What users will see

When they download your repository:

```
LanguagLearning/
├── Anki Arabic Template/
│   ├── Arabic Template.apkg    ← This file enables instant setup!
│   ├── README.md
│   └── CREATE_TEMPLATE.md
```

### Repository checklist before publishing

- [ ] Create `Arabic Template.apkg` using CREATE_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Test importing the `.apkg` file in a fresh Anki installation
- [ ] Verify all 8 fields are present
- [ ] Verify card styling displays correctly (Arabic right-to-left, etc.)
- [ ] Add to git: `git add "Anki Arabic Template/Arabic Template.apkg"`
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "Add Anki template for beginner-friendly setup"`
- [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push`

### Optional: Include a sample card

Consider adding one test card to the template so users can immediately see the card styling:

```
File Name: 0000_test_01
What is the Word?: مَرحَبا
Meaning of the Word: hello
Arabic Sentence: مَرحَبا، كيف حالك؟
IPA Transliteration: /marħaban, kayfa ħaluk/
English Sentence: Hello, how are you?
Sound: (empty)
Image: (empty)
```

This helps users verify the template works before generating their own cards.
