## 📋 Checklist Before Recording

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Read through all 4 scripts multiple times
- [ ] Time each script (should match 12/14/13/11 min)
- [ ] Create shot list (what screen you're on for each part)
- [ ] Prepare demo files (language selected, test data)
- [ ] Create graphics/thumbnail ideas
- [ ] Set up ElevenLabs account

### Recording Setup
- [ ] Test screen recording software (OBS, Camtasia, or ScreenFlow)
- [ ] Test microphone quality
- [ ] Close all unnecessary programs
- [ ] Disable notifications
- [ ] Use 1920x1080 resolution
- [ ] Record all screen recordings first (easier to match voiceover later)

### Voiceover Recording
- [ ] Read scripts naturally (not robotic)
- [ ] Record voiceovers in ElevenLabs
- [ ] Download MP3 files
- [ ] Label them: "Video1_Intro.mp3", "Video1_Problem.mp3", etc.

### Video 1 Description
```
After 8 years away from Chinese, I'm finally getting back to language learning—thanks to AI.

Eight years ago (February 2017), I made a video about building Anki cards for Chinese HSK. It was tedious. Life got busy. I quit.

Today? I created 6,250 professional Anki flashcards in just 2 hours using Google Gemini AI.

In this series, you'll learn how to do the same—for ANY of 109 languages.
