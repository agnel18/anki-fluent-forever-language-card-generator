## PART 1: THE METHOD & WHY IT WORKS (0:00-8:00)

### [INTRO - 0:00-1:00]

**[Hook - Start strong]**
"Eight years ago, I created a video about building Anki language cards for Chinese. I was studying for HSK 1 and 2, but creating those cards was incredibly tedious. Life got busy. Work took over. I lost touch with the language completely.

But something changed. AI evolved.

Today, I can create 6,250 professional Anki flashcards in just 2 hours. No copying. No pasting. No manually finding images or recording audio. Just press play and watch AI do all the work.

I'm getting back into Chinese. And this time, with AI, it's going to be different. I'm about to show you exactly how."

**[Visual: Show your 2017 YouTube video thumbnail → new 2025 video thumbnail → "Before: 1,000+ hours" vs "After: 2 hours" side-by-side]**

---

### [PROBLEM STATEMENT - 1:00-2:30]

**[The pain point]**
"I experienced this firsthand. Eight years ago, I was trying to learn Chinese. To create ONE professional card for a single Chinese word, you need:

- A natural sentence with the word (requires native speaker knowledge)
- Native speaker audio (expensive or hard to find)
- A relevant image (time-consuming search)
- Proper formatting for Anki (technical)

That takes 5-10 minutes per card. Just one.

Now, multiply that by 6,250 cards. Do the math.

That's 520 to 1,040 hours of tedious, repetitive work.

Nearly a full-time job. No wonder I quit and got busy with work instead.

Is it any wonder most language learners burn out? They don't finish the cards before life gets in the way."

**[Visual: Show timer ticking up to 1,000 hours]**

---

### [SOLUTION INTRO - 2:30-5:00]

**[The Fluent Forever Method]**
"Enter the Fluent Forever Method, created by Gabriel Wyner—a polyglot and cognitive scientist.

The method is simple: Don't just memorize words. Learn them in context.

Why? Because your brain doesn't store isolated words. It stores patterns, connections, and stories.

When you learn 'bread' alongside a sentence like 'I bought fresh bread at the bakery this morning,' your brain creates a web of connections: the word, the context, the image of a bakery, the sound of a native speaker.

That's why the method has three pillars:

**Pillar 1: Spaced Repetition**
Review cards at the exact moment you're about to forget them. Science shows this boosts retention by 300%.

**Pillar 2: Personalized Sentences**
Every word in context—10 different sentences per word for 10 different situations.

**Pillar 3: Multi-Sensory Learning**
Text, audio, and images all in one card. Your brain learns through multiple channels simultaneously.

The combination is incredibly powerful. Users report going from beginner to conversational fluency in 3-6 months using this method."

**[Visual: Show brain diagram connecting word + context + image + sound]**

---

### [BEFORE AI - 5:00-7:00]

**[The old way]**
"Before AI, creating even ONE Fluent Forever deck was almost impossible for regular people.

You'd have to:
1. Find a frequency word list (tedious manual research)
2. For each word, write 10 natural sentences (requires native speaker knowledge)
3. Record or find native audio (expensive, requires equipment)
4. Find relevant images (time-consuming, low quality)
5. Format everything for Anki (technical, error-prone)
6. Import media files (another tedious step)

The process was so painful that most people never finished.

That's why I created an automated version 8 years ago. But even that was limited. It used Google Translate for sentences, basic image search, and was hard to scale.

**Things have changed.**"

**[Visual: Show old video clip if you have it, or old screenshots]**

---

### [THE AI REVOLUTION - 7:00-9:00]

**[What's different now]**
"Three things happened:

**1. Google Gemini AI**
Today's language models can write natural, varied sentences instantly. Not just grammatically correct—contextually perfect.

With Gemini's free tier, you can generate 625 sentences for less than a penny per card.

**2. Native Speaker Audio**
soundoftext.com uses Google's text-to-speech to generate native speaker audio in 50+ languages.

Free. Legal. Natural-sounding.

**3. Smart Image Search**
Pexels API (free tier) connects to a massive database of royalty-free images.

And here's the clever part: Instead of searching for the word in your language (which often returns irrelevant results), we search using the English translation.

Want an image for 'хлеб' (Russian for 'bread')? We search for 'bread' and get perfect results every time.

**The result:**
We can now automate the entire process. From raw frequency word lists to ready-to-import Anki decks."

**[Visual: Show screenshots of each tool in action]**

### [WHAT YOU'LL GET - 8:00-8:30]

**[The outcome]**
"By the end of this video, you'll know how to:
- Set up all free tools (5 tools, $0 total)
- Generate 625 AI-written sentences in any language
- Download native speaker audio automatically
- Find relevant images for each word using smart keyword extraction
- Generate IPA phonetic transcriptions (AI + epitran fallback)
- Import everything into Anki **directly as .apkg file** (double-click to import!)
- Get 3 learning modes per word (Listening, Production, Reading)

And you'll have a complete, professional language learning deck with dark/light mode support ready to use."

This is the same method used by polyglots and language professionals. Now you can build it in 2-3 hours instead of 1,000+ hours.

Stick with me. This is going to change how you learn languages."

Click the green 'Code' button. Click 'Download ZIP.'

When it finishes downloading, right-click the file and click 'Extract All...'

Choose where to extract it. Desktop is fine.

This gives you all our scripts and files. They're pre-written. You're not writing code—you're just using them."

**[Visual: Screen recording of GitHub download]**

---

### [SET UP .ENV FILE - 17:00-18:30]

**[Step-by-step]**

"Now for the final step: the '.env' file. This is where you put your API keys so our scripts can use them.

Open the folder you just extracted. 

Look for a file called '.env.example' (or '.env').

Open it with VS Code.

It will look like this:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=paste_your_google_api_key_here
PEXELS_API_KEY=paste_your_pexels_api_key_here
```

Replace 'paste_your_google_api_key_here' with the Google Gemini key you copied earlier.

Replace 'paste_your_pexels_api_key_here' with the Pexels key you copied.

**Save the file.**

Done. Your API keys are now stored securely. Never share this file with anyone."

**[Visual: Screen recording showing file being edited]**

---

### [VERIFICATION & SELECT LANGUAGE - 18:30-20:00]

**[Final check + language selection]**

"Let's verify everything works.

Open VS Code. In the terminal, type:

**python -c \"import google.generativeai; print('Success!')\"**

If you see 'Success!' printed, you're good.

If you see an error, don't panic. Try:

**pip install google-generativeai requests python-dotenv**

Now, let's pick your language.

Type: **python 0_select_language.py**

You'll see a numbered list of 109 languages. Pick yours. Type the number and press Enter.

Done. The system is now configured for your language.

You're all set. Next section: We generate your cards."

**[Visual: Show checklist with everything checked off]**

## PART 3: GENERATE YOUR 625 CARDS (20:00-35:00)

### [INTRO TO GENERATION - 20:00-21:00]

**[Energy]**
"Now for the magic.

We're about to generate 625 professional language cards completely automatically.

You literally just press play and watch AI work.

In the next 15 minutes, I'll show you how to run the scripts. Then in about 2 hours of mostly unattended time, you'll have:
- 625 personalized sentences
- 625 native speaker audio files
- 625 relevant images
- One ready-to-import file

All without touching a single line of code.

Let's do this."

**[Visual: Show finished example cards from multiple languages]**

---

### [SCRIPT 1: GENERATE SENTENCES - 21:00-24:00]

**[Explanation]**
"Script 1 generates sentences using Google Gemini AI.

Here's what it does behind the scenes:
- Takes your language's frequency word list
- For each word, generates 10 natural sentences
- Varies the tense, formality, and context
- Stores everything in a spreadsheet

Open VS Code. Make sure you're in your project folder.

Type in the terminal: **python 1_generate_sentences.py**

Press Enter.

You'll see output scrolling by. Don't worry about understanding it—it's just progress indicators.

Generating 625 sentences takes about 20-30 minutes depending on your internet speed.

This is a good time to grab coffee or check your phone. The script will keep running."

**[Visual: Screen recording of script running, fast-forwarded]**

---

### [SCRIPT 2: DOWNLOAD AUDIO - 24:00-27:00]

**[Explanation]**
"Script 2 downloads native speaker audio.

Type: **python 2_download_audio.py**

It uses soundoftext.com to generate high-quality audio for each sentence.

Important: This script respects rate limits. It adds delays between requests so we don't overload the server. Be respectful of free services.

Downloading 625 audio files takes about 60-90 minutes depending on internet speed and server load.

Again, mostly unattended. You're just watching progress.

**Pro tip:** If the script stops (network error, computer sleep, power loss), just run it again. It automatically picks up where it left off. Nothing is lost.

This is why we love this system—it's restart-friendly.

Go do something else. Come back in an hour."

**[Visual: Screen recording of script running]**

---

### [SCRIPT 3: DOWNLOAD IMAGES - 27:00-30:00]

**[Explanation]**
"Script 3 downloads relevant images from Pexels.

Type: **python 3_download_images.py**

Here's the clever part: Instead of searching in your language (which often returns weird results), we search using the English translation.

For example, if you're learning Arabic for 'خبز' (khubz = bread), we search Pexels for 'bread' and get perfect, relevant results.

Each image is a small thumbnail to keep file sizes low.

Downloading 625 images takes about 30-45 minutes.

By the end, you'll have a folder full of high-quality, relevant images for every single card.

Again, unattended. Go do something else while this runs."

**[Visual: Show examples of downloaded images from different languages]**

---

### [SCRIPT 4: EXPORT TO TSV - 30:00-35:00]

**[Explanation]**
"Finally, Script 4 packages everything into one Anki-import file.

Type: **python 4_create_anki_tsv.py**

This creates 'ANKI_IMPORT.tsv' - a file Anki can read and import instantly.

This step takes less than a minute.

And you're done. By now, you have:
✓ 625 sentences (AI-generated)
✓ 625 audio files (native speakers)
✓ 625 images (relevant, high-quality)
✓ 1 TSV file (ready to import)

All from your language of choice.

All completely automated.

In 2 hours, what would have taken 520 hours to do manually is done.

You can see all your files in the project folder:
- /audio folder (625 MP3 files)
- /images folder (625 JPG files)
- ANKI_IMPORT.tsv (ready to import)

Ready to import? Let's move to the final section."

**[Visual: Show folder structure with all generated files]**

---

---

## PART 4: IMPORT INTO ANKI & START LEARNING (35:00-48:30)

### [INTRO TO IMPORT - 35:00-35:30]

**[Energy]**
"You've built your deck. Now let's use it.

In this final section:
- Import 625 cards into Anki (5 minutes)
- Set up your first study session
- Learn pro tips for language learning success
- Scale to 6,250+ cards if you want more

By the end, you'll be studying with a professional-grade language learning system that used to take thousands of hours to create.

Let's go."

---

### [IMPORT TSV INTO ANKI - 35:30-37:00]

**[Step-by-step]**

"Open Anki.

Go to File → Import.

Select the 'ANKI_IMPORT.tsv' file from your project folder.

You'll see an import dialog. The defaults are usually fine, but:
- Make sure 'Comma' is set to 'Tab' (since we're importing TSV)
- Click 'Import'

Anki will tell you how many cards were imported. It should say '625 cards' or close to it.

Done. Your cards are now in Anki."

**[Visual: Screen recording of import process]**

---

### [ORGANIZE YOUR DECK - 37:00-38:30]

**[Step-by-step]**

"Now let's organize.

In Anki, you'll see your cards in a deck. You can rename the deck to something nice.

Right-click the deck → Rename → pick a name like 'Spanish - Fluent Forever' or 'Arabic - Top 625 Words'

You can also create sub-decks for different levels or topics. For now, keeping everything in one deck is fine.

Look at one of your cards. You'll see:
- The word in your target language
- The sentence
- The English translation
- The audio (click the speaker icon)
- The image

Click the cards to familiarize yourself with the format."

**[Visual: Screen recording showing deck organization]**

---

### [COPY MEDIA FILES - 38:30-40:00]

**[Step-by-step]**

"Anki needs the audio and image files to work.

In your project folder, you have:
- /audio (625 MP3 files)
- /images (625 JPG files)

Copy both folders.

In Windows, Anki stores media here:
**C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\[Profile Name]\collection.media**

Paste the files there.

(If you're on Mac or Linux, the path is slightly different—Google it or ask in the comments.)

Now your cards will show the audio and images when you study."

**[Visual: Screen recording of file copying]**

---

### [YOUR FIRST STUDY SESSION - 40:00-42:00]

**[Walkthrough]**

"Time to study.

Click your deck. Click 'Study Now.'

Anki will show you cards one by one. For each card:
1. Read the sentence
2. Click the speaker icon to hear the audio
3. Try to understand it without looking at the translation
4. Click to reveal the English translation
5. Rate your confidence (Again = forgot, Hard = barely remembered, Good = knew it, Easy = easy)

That's it. Based on your rating, Anki schedules when to show you the card next.

You want your goal to be mostly 'Good' and 'Easy.'

Study 10-20 cards today. Don't overdo it. Consistency matters more than volume.

Tomorrow, study again. The same cards will appear, plus new ones. Anki handles the scheduling automatically."

**[Visual: Screen recording of study session]**

---

### [PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS - 42:00-45:00]

**[Real advice]**

"Here's what actually works:

**Tip 1: Study consistently, not intensely**
15 minutes a day beats 2 hours once a week. Your brain needs repetition.

**Tip 2: Combine with immersion**
After your Anki session, watch a YouTube video or podcast in your target language. That's where real learning happens.

**Tip 3: Don't memorize, understand**
When you see a card, try to understand it. Don't just memorize the translation. Read the sentence. Think about why the translation makes sense.

**Tip 4: Speak it out loud**
When you hear the audio, repeat it. Speak the words. This engages your speaking muscles and reinforces memory.

**Tip 5: Customize as you go**
Anki lets you add notes to cards. If a sentence is confusing, add a note explaining it. Make the cards yours.

**Tip 6: Celebrate milestones**
Every 100 cards reviewed is progress. Every 1,000 cards is major. Celebrate these moments.

**Tip 7: Scale when ready**
After you've completed this batch, you can generate more cards. Want 6,250 cards instead of 625?

In PowerShell (Windows):
**$env:BATCH_WORDS=100; python 1_generate_sentences.py**

This tells the script to process 100 words at a time instead of just a few.

Just rerun scripts 2, 3, and 4, then import the new cards into Anki. Anki automatically prevents duplicates."

**[Visual: Show Anki tips graphically + scaling example]**

---

### [SCALING TO 6,250+ CARDS - 45:00-48:00]

**[How to add more]**

"Right now you have 625 cards (62 words × 10 sentences each).

To scale to 6,250 cards (625 words), repeat the process:

**Option 1: In batches**
Generate 100 words at a time. It takes about 4-5 hours per batch. Do it weekly or whenever you want.

**Option 2: All at once**
Set the batch size to 625 and generate all 6,250 cards in one go. Takes about a day, but then you have everything.

**Option 3: Different languages**
Don't want more Spanish cards? Generate a completely different language! Repeat the language selection step, and generate a new batch for that language.

The system is flexible. You control how much you want to generate, when, and for which language.

The same method works for all 109 languages.

If you have 625 Spanish cards, you can add 625 French cards. Then Arabic. Then Japanese. Your Anki deck can contain cards from multiple languages if you want.

The possibilities are endless."

**[Visual: Show environment variable setting + multiple language examples]**
