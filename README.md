# Fluent Forever Anki Language Card Generator

Generate professional language learning cards for Anki with sentences, audio, images, and IPA transliterations using Google Gemini API. **Support for 109 languages** with frequency word lists, dynamic language selection, and intelligent sentence generation.

**Based on the [Fluent Forever method](https://fluent-forever.com/) by Gabriel Wyner** - A proven language learning system using spaced repetition, personalized sentences, and multi-sensory memory techniques.

📖 **Book:** [Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Forever-Learn-Language-Forget/dp/0385348118) by Gabriel Wyner

## About This Repository

- Language-agnostic pipeline (109 frequency lists included) with one-click language selection.
- Packaged Anki note-type: `Anki Arabic Template/Language Learning Template.apkg` (no manual setup; works for any language, rename deck after import).
- Modernized media pipeline: Gemini sentences, soundoftext audio, Pexels thumbnails via English translation, restartable scripts.
- Outputs ready for Anki import: TSV + media under `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/`.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Sentences**: Uses Google Gemini API to generate **10 natural sentences per word** (maximum token efficiency)
- ✅ **All Use Cases Covered**: Different grammatical contexts, tenses, formality levels, and real-world usage
- 🌍 **109 Languages Supported**: Instantly switch between any language with 1 command
- 📋 **Built-in Frequency Lists**: Curated most-common-words lists for all languages (ready to use)
- 🔊 **Audio**: Downloads native speaker audio from soundoftext.com (50+ language support)
- 🖼️ **Images**: Downloads clean thumbnail images from **Pexels** (uses English translation for better results)
- 📝 **IPA Transliteration**: Includes International Phonetic Alphabet for pronunciation
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Tracks processing status for each word
- 🔄 **Restartable**: Each script is independent and can be restarted without losing work
- ⚙️ **Language-Agnostic**: Works with any language's frequency list

### Image Download (Pexels) – Setup, Benefits, and Ethics

- **Setup:** Add your Pexels API key to `.env` (kept out of git).
   ```
   PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key_here
   ```
- **How it works:** Script 3 (`3_download_images.py`) searches **Pexels** with the **English translation** of each sentence and downloads a **thumbnail** (`tiny`) to keep downloads light and fast.
- **Rate limits:** Pexels free tier is roughly **~200 requests/hour**. A full deck (6,250 images) should be run in batches (e.g., 200–400 images, pause 1–2 hours, then continue) to avoid throttling.
- **Ethical use:** Respect the rate limits, avoid excessive retries, and keep usage to personal learning. Using thumbnails reduces bandwidth impact on Pexels and speeds up your workflow.

## Why Use This Script?

### The Fluent Forever Method: Smart, Not Hard

The **Fluent Forever method** by Gabriel Wyner is proven to accelerate language acquisition through:
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review cards at optimal intervals for long-term retention
- **Personalized Sentences**: Learn words in context, not isolation
- **Multi-Sensory Learning**: Combine text, audio, and images for stronger memory
- **Frequency-Based Learning**: Start with the most common words (80/20 rule)

### Why Automate Card Creation?

**Without this script:**
- ⏳ Creating 1 card manually: 5-10 minutes (find sentence, record/download audio, find image, format)
- 📚 Creating 625 Fluent Forever words × 10 sentences = **6,250 cards**
- ⏱️ Total manual time: **520-1,040 hours** of tedious copy-paste work
- 😫 Burnout risk: Extremely high—most learners quit before finishing

**With this script:**
- ⚡ Creating 1 card automatically: **45 seconds** (fully automated)
- 📚 6,250 cards = **~52 hours** of mostly unattended runtime
- 🎯 Your time investment: **2-3 hours** (setup + review + import)
- ✅ More time for what matters: **immersion, speaking practice, and actual learning**

### Focus on Real Learning

By automating card creation, you can spend your time on activities that truly matter:

1. **🎧 Immersion**: Watch TV shows, YouTube videos, and movies in your target language
2. **🎙️ Podcasts**: Listen to native speakers while commuting or exercising
3. **📖 Reading**: Consume books, articles, and social media in the target language
4. **💬 Speaking Practice**: Use iTalki, HelloTalk, or language exchange partners
5. **📝 Grammar Study**: Focus on understanding structure, not creating flashcards
6. **🎯 Anki Reviews**: Spend your study time reviewing cards, not making them

**Research shows**: Active immersion and output practice accelerate fluency far more than card creation. This script handles the busywork so you can focus on real language exposure.

## 🌍 Multi-Language Support: 109 Languages Ready to Go!

This tool supports **109 languages** with pre-made frequency word lists. No need to find or format data yourself!

### Supported Languages

**Complete List (109 total):**
Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chichewa, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Corsican, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Galician, Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Haitian Creole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian, Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Scots Gaelic, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa, Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

### Frequency Word Lists Source

All frequency lists come from: **[most-common-words-multilingual](https://github.com/frekwencja/most-common-words-multilingual)**

Credits: Data sourced from publicly available language corpora and frequency analysis.

### How to Use Any Language

The new **language selection system** makes it trivial to switch languages:

#### Step 1: Run Language Selector (First Time Only)

```bash
python 0_select_language.py
```

You'll see:
```
🌍 FLUENT FOREVER - LANGUAGE SELECTION
============================================================

✅ Found 109 languages available

  1. Afrikaans (AF)
  2. Albanian (SQ)
  ...
 71. Malayalam (ML)
 ...
109. Zulu (ZU)

Enter language number (1-109): 71
```

Select your language, and the system will:
- ✅ Load the frequency list automatically
- ✅ Create `language_config.txt` with your language settings
- ✅ Create output folder: `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/`

#### Step 2: Generate Cards

```bash
# Generate 10 sentences per word (all use cases)
python 1_generate_sentences.py

# Repeat for all 625 words
python 1_generate_sentences.py
python 1_generate_sentences.py
# ... etc
```

That's it! Everything else works the same.

### Example: Learning Malayalam

Complete walkthrough: See **[MALAYALAM_USE_CASE.md](MALAYALAM_USE_CASE.md)**

### Example: Learning Spanish

```bash
# 1. Select language
python 0_select_language.py
# Choose: 96. Spanish (ES)

# 2. Generate sentences
for i in {1..625}; do python 1_generate_sentences.py; done

# 3. Download audio (Spanish support excellent!)
for i in {1..625}; do python 2_download_audio.py; done

# 4. Download images
for i in {1..625}; do python 3_download_images.py; done

# 5. Create TSV
python 4_create_anki_tsv.py

# 6. Import to Anki (6,250 cards!)
```

### Adapting to Your Language

If your language isn't in the list, you can:

1. Find a frequency list online (Wiktionary has many)
2. Create an Excel file: `{Language} Word` | `Meaning` | `Status`
3. Update `language_config.txt` manually:
   ```
   language_name=Your Language
   language_code=YL
   frequency_file=/path/to/your/file.xlsx
   output_dir=FluentForever_Your_Language_Perfect
   ```
4. Run the scripts normally

## How Sentence Generation Works (10 Sentences = Maximum Benefit)

### Why 10 Sentences Per Word?

**Token Efficiency:** Each API call generates 10 sentences, maximizing the use of your Gemini API tokens.
- Before: 5 sentences per call = 625 words × 1 call = 625 API calls
- Now: 10 sentences per call = 625 words × 0.5 calls ≈ 313 API calls
- **50% fewer API calls, 2x more cards!**

### All Use Cases Covered

Each set of 10 sentences covers:

1. **Grammatical roles**: Subject, object, predicate, indirect object
2. **Tenses/moods**: Present, past, future, conditional, subjunctive
3. **Formality levels**: Formal, informal, colloquial, slang
4. **Real-world contexts**: Daily life, work, school, academic, idioms
5. **Different sentence structures**: Simple, compound, complex

Example for Malayalam word "വീട്" (veet - house):
- Simple: "വീട് വലുതാണ്" (The house is big)
- Possessive: "എന്റെ വീട് പ്രകാശമയമാണ്" (My house is bright)
- Locative: "വീട്ടിൽ ആളുകൾ ഉണ്ട്" (There are people in the house)
- ... and 7 more examples

This ensures you learn **all uses** of each word, not just one basic example!

## Quick Start for Other Languages

This tool is now **completely language-agnostic**:

### Quick Start for Other Languages

1. **Update Script 1** (`1_generate_sentences.py`):
   ```python
   # Line ~65: Change the language name and IPA requirement
   prompt = f"""
   You are a {YOUR_LANGUAGE} language expert. Generate 5 example sentences using the word "{word}" ({meaning}).
   Each sentence must:
   - Use the word naturally in {YOUR_LANGUAGE} context
   - Be 5-12 words long
   - Include IPA transliteration for {YOUR_LANGUAGE} pronunciation
   - Have an accurate English translation
   """
   ```

2. **Update Script 2** (`2_download_audio.py`):
   - **Option A**: Keep soundoftext.com (supports 50+ languages)
     ```python
     # Line ~35: Change voice selection
     voice_dropdown = driver.find_element(By.ID, "voice")
     voice_dropdown.send_keys("{LANGUAGE_CODE}")  # e.g., "Spanish", "French", "Japanese"
     ```
   - **Option B**: Use Google TTS or Azure TTS for better quality (requires code changes)

3. **Update Script 3** (`3_download_images.py`):
   - No changes needed! Image search works for any language
   - Optionally adjust search keywords for better results:
     ```python
     # Line ~80: Add language-specific context
     search_query = f"{english_sentence} pure image {YOUR_LANGUAGE} culture"
     ```

4. **Update Excel File**:
   - Rename `Arabic Frequency Word List.xlsx` → `{Language} Frequency Word List.xlsx`
   - Add your target language's most common words (find frequency lists online)
   - Keep same columns: `Word`, `English Meaning`, `Status`

5. **Update Output Folder**:
   ```python
   # In all scripts: Change folder name
   OUTPUT_DIR = "FluentForever_{YOUR_LANGUAGE}_Perfect"
   ```

### Language-Specific Considerations

**For Non-Latin Scripts** (Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, etc.):
- ✅ Script already handles Unicode correctly
- ✅ IPA transliteration automatically generated by Gemini
- ⚠️ Verify soundoftext.com supports your language's TTS

**For Tonal Languages** (Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai):
- ✅ IPA includes tone markers
- ⚠️ Verify audio quality (may need native speaker recordings)

**For Languages with Dialects** (Spanish, Arabic, Chinese):
- 🔧 Specify dialect in prompt: "Mexican Spanish", "Egyptian Arabic", "Mandarin Chinese"
- 🔧 Choose appropriate TTS voice in Script 2

### Example: Adapting to Spanish

1. Update prompt in Script 1:
   ```python
   prompt = f"You are a Spanish language expert. Generate 5 example sentences using '{word}' ({meaning})..."
   ```
2. Update voice in Script 2: `voice_dropdown.send_keys("Spanish")`
3. Rename Excel: `Spanish Frequency Word List.xlsx`
4. Add Spanish frequency words (e.g., "el", "de", "que", "y", "a"...)
5. Update output folder: `FluentForever_Spanish_Perfect`

**Total adaptation time: 10-15 minutes** ⚡

### Resources for Frequency Lists

- **Free**: Wiktionary frequency lists (most languages)
- **Book**: "Fluent Forever" by Gabriel Wyner (includes 625-word lists for major languages)
- **Paid**: Routledge Frequency Dictionaries (academic-quality lists)
- **Online**: Use Corpus databases (e.g., OPUS for parallel corpora)

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome browser (for Selenium automation)
- Internet connection
- Google Gemini API key (free tier)

```bash
python 0_select_language.py
```

Choose from **109 languages**. The system will:
- Load the pre-made frequency word list
- Create `language_config.txt` with your language settings
- Create output folder: `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/`

**Example:**
```
python 0_select_language.py
→ Select: 71. Malayalam (ML)
→ Output: FluentForever_Malayalam_Perfect/
```

### Script 1: Generate Sentences (`1_generate_sentences.py`)

Generates **10 natural sentences** for each word using Gemini API (all use cases covered!).

- Reads next word with empty Status
- Generates 10 sentences covering different grammatical contexts, tenses, formality levels
- Saves to `working_data.xlsx` for review
- Updates Status → `sentences_done`

**Run:**
```bash
python 1_generate_sentences.py
# Repeat 625 times for all frequency words
```

### Script 2: Download Audio (`2_download_audio.py`)

Downloads native speaker audio from soundoftext.com (50+ languages supported).

- Finds words with Status=`sentences_done`
- Downloads MP3 for each sentence using Selenium
- Saves to `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/audio/`
- Updates Sound column with `[sound:filename.mp3]`
- Updates Status → `audio_done`

**Run:**
```bash
python LanguagLearning/2_download_audio.py
```

### Script 3: Download Images (`3_download_images.py`)
Downloads clean thumbnail images from **Pexels** using the **English translation** of each sentence (better relevance, lower bandwidth).
- Finds words with Status=`audio_done`
- Queries Pexels with the English translation; downloads thumbnail (`tiny`) to save bandwidth
- Saves to `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/images/`
- Updates Image column with `<img src="filename.jpg">`
- (Rate limits) Free tier is ~200 requests/hour → run in batches if needed

**Advanced Users:** Want to customize the template or create your own from scratch? See [ANKI_SETUP.md](ANKI_SETUP.md) for detailed manual setup instructions

3. **Import TSV**:
   - File → **Import**
   - Select `ANKI_IMPORT.tsv`
   - Choose the note type from the template (preloaded by `Language Learning Template.apkg`)
   - Select your target-language deck
   - Click **Import**

### Import Media Files

After importing TSV, you need to add the audio and image files:

1. In Anki, click **Tools** → **Check Media**
2. Click **View Files** to open the media folder
3. In your file explorer, navigate to `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/audio/`
4. Select all MP3 files (Ctrl+A)
5. Copy them (Ctrl+C)
6. Go back to Anki's media folder
7. Paste (Ctrl+V)
8. Repeat for images from `FluentForever_{Language}_Perfect/images/`

⚠️ **Important**: Copy the individual files, NOT the folders!

## Usage Example

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Generate sentences for word 1
python LanguagLearning/1_generate_sentences.py
# Output: sentences_done status, 5 rows in working_data.xlsx

# Generate sentences for words 2-10 (repeat script 10 times, or create a loop)
python LanguagLearning/1_generate_sentences.py
python LanguagLearning/1_generate_sentences.py
# ... etc

# After all words have sentences, download audio for all
python LanguagLearning/2_download_audio.py
python LanguagLearning/2_download_audio.py
# ... repeat until audio_done for all words

# Then download images for all
python LanguagLearning/3_download_images.py
python LanguagLearning/3_download_images.py
# ... repeat until images_done for all words

# Finally, generate Anki TSV
python LanguagLearning/4_create_anki_tsv.py

# Import ANKI_IMPORT.tsv into Anki following instructions above
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No rows with Status=sentences_done"
- Run script 1 first to generate sentences
- Check your `<Language> Frequency Word List.xlsx` has empty Status column

### Audio download fails
- Check internet connection
- soundoftext.com may be temporarily down, try again later
- If many requests in a row, wait 1–2 minutes and rerun

### Image download fails
- Ensure `PEXELS_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check internet connection
- Pexels free tier rate limit is ~200 requests/hour; wait and rerun if you hit it
- Some words may simply have no good results; add manually if needed

### Permission denied on Excel
- Close Excel files before running scripts
- Files are locked while open in Excel

### Media files don't show in Anki
- Ensure file paths in TSV match actual filenames
- Copy individual files to collection.media folder (not folders)
- Run **Tools** → **Check Media** again

## Output Fields

Each Anki card contains:

| Field | Example | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| File Name | 0001_word_01 | {freq:04d}_{word}_{sentence:02d} |
| What is the Word? | palabra | Target word |
| Meaning of the Word | word | English translation |
| Arabic Sentence | La palabra es útil. | Target-language sentence (field name kept for compatibility) |
| IPA Transliteration | /paˈlaβɾa/ | IPA pronunciation |
| English Sentence | The word is useful. | English translation |
| Sound | [sound:0001_word_01.mp3] | Anki sound tag |
| Image | <img src="0001_word_01.jpg"> | Anki image tag |

## API Costs

- **Google Gemini API**: Free tier available (up to 15 requests/minute)
- **Audio (soundoftext.com)**: Free
- **Images (Pexels API thumbnails)**: Free tier (rate limited ~200 requests/hour)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Script Usage

1. **Review working_data.xlsx** before running script 2
   - Check if sentences are appropriate
   - Delete any rows you don't want
   - Status won't update until all 5 are present

2. **Run scripts in order** (1→2→3→4)
   - Each script depends on previous status

3. **Test on small batch first**
   - Try 2-3 words before full workflow

4. **Close Excel files** before running scripts
   - Prevents file lock errors

5. **Check media folder** before importing into Anki
   - Ensure audio/images are present and named correctly

### Learning Strategy

6. **Let the script run in the background**
   - Scripts 2 & 3 can run unattended
   - Use this time for immersion: watch Netflix, listen to podcasts
   - Check progress every 30 minutes

7. **Batch process efficiently**
   - Generate sentences for 50 words (Script 1: ~5 minutes)
   - Run Script 2 for all 50 words (unattended, ~12 minutes)
   - Run Script 3 for all 50 words (unattended, ~17 minutes)
   - Import to Anki and START LEARNING

8. **Prioritize review over creation**
   - 30 minutes of Anki reviews > 30 minutes of card creation
   - This script automates creation so you can focus on actual learning

9. **Use Anki mobile app**
   - Review cards during commute, waiting in line, etc.
   - Audio works on mobile (great for pronunciation practice)

10. **Combine with immersion**
    - After learning 100 words: start watching kids' shows
    - After 300 words: try podcasts for learners
    - After 625 words: dive into native content (news, TV, books)

## Performance

**Per Word Timing:**
- Script 0 (Select Language): One-time setup, ~30 seconds
- Script 1 (Generate 10 Sentences): ~10 seconds per word (token-optimized batch calls)
- Script 2 (Download 10 Audio Files): ~25 seconds per word
- Script 3 (Download 10 Images): ~35 seconds per word
- Script 4 (Create TSV): ~2 seconds total

**Total per word: ~70 seconds**

**Total for 625 words (Fluent Forever deck):**
- Time investment: ~7 hours of *unattended* runtime
- Your actual work: ~30 minutes setup + review
- Output: 6,250 professional Anki cards (10x more than before!)

**API Costs:**
- Google Gemini: FREE (generous rate limits)
- Audio download: FREE
- Image download: FREE
- **Total project cost: $0**
