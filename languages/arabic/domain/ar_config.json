COUNT words precisely; if >{max_length}, it's INVALID – regenerate internally\n- Difficulty: {difficulty}\n  - beginner: Use only simple vocabulary and grammar, mostly present tense\n  - intermediate: Use mixed tenses, richer but still natural language\n  - advanced: Use complex structures, nuanced vocabulary, and advanced grammar\n\nVARIETY REQUIREMENTS:\n- Use different tenses (past, present, future, imperative)\n- Use different sentence types: declarative, interrogative, imperative\n- Use the target word in different grammatical roles if possible\n{context_instruction}\n\n===========================\nSTEP 3: ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS\n===========================\nFor EACH sentence above, provide a natural, fluent English translation.\n- Translation should be natural English, not literal word-for-word\n- Maintain the same meaning and nuance as the original sentence\n- Use appropriate English grammar and idioms\n\n===========================\nSTEP 4: IPA PRONUNCIATION\n===========================\nFor EACH sentence above, provide official IPA symbols only (not romanization, not any non-IPA symbols).\n- IPA must be accurate for Modern Standard Arabic pronunciation\n- Include stress marks and proper phonetic transcription\n- Cover the entire sentence, not just the target word\n\n===========================\nSTEP 5: IMAGE KEYWORDS\n===========================\nFor EACH sentence above, generate exactly 3 diverse and specific keywords for image search.\n- Keywords MUST be SPECIFIC/concrete (e.g., 'Arabic coffee pot on ornate tray' not 'beverage'); avoid generics like 'Arabic' or 'language'\n- Focus on concrete objects, actions, or scenes that represent the sentence\n- Keywords should be in English only\n\n===========================\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n===========================\nReturn your response in this exact text format:\n\nMEANING: [brief English meaning]\n\nRESTRICTIONS: [grammatical restrictions identified]\n\nSENTENCES:\n1.

[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]\n2. [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]\n3. [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Return ONLY the formatted text, no extra explanation\n- Sentences must be in Arabic only\n- Translations must be natural, fluent English\n- IPA must use official IPA symbols only\n- Keywords must be comma-separated\n- Ensure exactly {num_sentences} sentences, translations, IPA transcriptions, and keywords\n"
