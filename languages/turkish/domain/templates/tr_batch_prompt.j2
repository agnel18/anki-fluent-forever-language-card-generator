# Turkish Batch Sentence Analysis Template
# Used for analyzing multiple Turkish sentences efficiently

Analyze these Turkish sentences:
{{sentences}}

Target word: {{target_word}}
Complexity level: {{complexity}}
Number of sentences: {{sentence_count}}

TURKISH GRAMMAR ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS:
- Identify root words in agglutinated forms across all sentences
- Break down suffixes and their functions consistently
- Note vowel harmony patterns (back/front vowels)
- Identify case markers and their grammatical functions

GRAMMATICAL ROLES (use these exact categories):
{{grammatical_roles_list}}

CASE SYSTEM (6 cases in Turkish):
- Nominative: subject case, no marker
- Accusative: direct object, -(y)i marker
- Dative: indirect object/direction, -(y)e marker
- Locative: location, -(d)e marker
- Ablative: source/origin, -(d)en marker
- Genitive: possession, -(n)in marker

VOWEL HARMONY RULES:
- Back vowels: a, o, u
- Front vowels: e, ö, ü
- Suffix vowels must harmonize with root's last vowel
- Check harmony across all sentences consistently

WORD ORDER PATTERNS:
- Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) is normal
- Flexible due to case markers
- Question formation patterns
- Relative clause structures

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return JSON with this exact structure:

CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:
1. Use ONLY the grammatical roles listed above
2. Maintain consistency across all sentences
3. Include morphological notes in individual_meaning when relevant
4. Colors must be valid hex codes
5. Identify all case markers and their functions
6. Note vowel harmony patterns and violations
7. Explain agglutination structures clearly
8. Ensure sentence_number matches input order
