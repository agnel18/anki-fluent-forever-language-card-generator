## Key Talking Points for Videos

### Video 1 (Hook)
**Opening Story:**
"Eight years ago, I was studying Chinese for HSK 1 and 2. Creating those cards was so tedious that I eventually quit when work got busy. Life happened. I haven't touched Chinese since.

But now? AI has changed everything. Today I created 625 Chinese cards in 2 hours. I'm getting back into it. And I want to show you how."

**Why It Matters:**
- Relatable (people abandon language learning due to card creation burden)
- Authentic (you've actually done this)
- Hope (AI brings you back)
- Demonstration (Chinese is your target language)

### Video 2 (Setup)
"We're setting up for Chinese cards today. But everything here works for any of 109 languages."

### Video 3 (Generation)
"Watch as we generate 625 Chinese cards in 2 hours."

**Real example:** HSK 1 words like 学 (study), 水 (water), 面包 (bread), etc.

### Video 4 (Import & Study)
"I'm getting back into Chinese after 8 years. Here's my study plan:
- 15 minutes of Anki cards (Chinese)
- 15 minutes of immersion (Chinese YouTube/podcast)
- Daily consistency

This is how I'm getting fluent again."
